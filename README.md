## Assignment
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and advanced data preprocessing on simulated patient data leveraging Generative AI (GenAI), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Small Language Models (SLMs). The dataset will cover six vital signs (oxygen saturation, heart rate, temperature, blood pressure, weight, and blood glucose), questionnaire responses, and timestamps

## Project
Leverage AI technologies, including Large Language Models (LLMs), Small Language Models (SLMs), and Generative AI (GenAI), to engineer features and build predictive models for anticipating patient health deterioration based on collected vital signs and health questionnaire responses.
